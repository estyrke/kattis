# My solutions to Kattis problems

This repo contains solutions to problems from the [Kattis Problem Archive](https://open.kattis.com). Most are written in Go so far.

## Initializing a new problem

    go run github.com/estyrke/kattis/kattis-init <problem-id>

This downloads the problem description and converts it to Markdown,
downloads and unpacks the sample input and output, and places it
in an appropriately-named subdirectory along with a go module skeleton.
